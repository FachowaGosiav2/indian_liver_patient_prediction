## Function Name: cross_validation()

### Description:
This function performs k-fold cross-validation on a given machine learning model using the input features (X) and target variable (y) provided. It returns the mean score of the model's performance across all the folds.

### Parameters:

X: Input features (data matrix) of shape (n_samples, n_features).
y: Target variable (label vector) of shape (n_samples,).
model_clf: Machine learning model object that implements the sklearn API, such as a classifier or regressor.
Returns:

model_clf_score.mean(): Mean score of the model's performance across all the folds.
Dependencies:

This function requires the following modules from the scikit-learn library: cross_val_score.
It also uses the 'n_jobs' parameter in the cross_val_score function, which allows for parallel computation of cross-validation folds.

## Function Name: acc_rec_f1_roc_aug_score()

### Description:
This function calculates and prints the accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score of a given machine learning model's predictions using the input features (X) and target variable (y) provided.

### Parameters:

X: Input features (data matrix) of shape (n_samples, n_features).
y: Target variable (label vector) of shape (n_samples,).
model_clf: Machine learning model object that implements the sklearn API, such as a classifier or regressor.
Dependencies:

This function requires the following modules from the scikit-learn library: accuracy_score, recall_score, f1_score, and roc_auc_score.

## Function Name: fit_and_score_model()

### Description:
This function fits a given machine learning model to the training data (X, y) and calculates the model's score (e.g., accuracy, R-squared, etc.) on the validation data (X_v, y_v). The score is returned as the output of the function.

### Parameters:

X: Input features (training data) of shape (n_samples, n_features).
y: Target variable (training labels) of shape (n_samples,).
model_clf: Machine learning model object that implements the sklearn API, such as a classifier or regressor.
X_v: Input features (validation data) of shape (n_samples_v, n_features).
y_v: Target variable (validation labels) of shape (n_samples_v,).
### Returns:

model_clf.score(X_v, y_v): The score of the trained model on the validation data (X_v, y_v).
Dependencies:

This function requires the 'fit' and 'score' methods from the machine learning model object, as well as any relevant modules or libraries imported for the model.
